Subject: Re: Memory Limit and Memory Leak - Clarification

Dear [Manager's Name],

Certainly, I understand your concern. Let me provide a concise overview:

**Memory Limit:** The memory limit is the maximum memory a pod can use. Increasing this won't address the root cause.

**Memory Leak:** A memory leak occurs when an app retains unneeded data, causing growing memory usage.

**Increasing Limit Won't Fix Leak:** While raising the limit might provide temporary relief, it's not a lasting solution. The app will keep consuming more memory due to leaks.

**Best Solution:** We need to find and fix the memory leaks in the app's code to ensure efficient memory usage.

I'll work closely with the team to tackle the issue effectively.

Feel free to connect if you have further questions.

Best Regards,
[Your Name]
