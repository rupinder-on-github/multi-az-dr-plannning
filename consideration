Creating a disaster recovery (DR) plan for an application hosted on AWS cloud is an essential step in ensuring that your application remains available and functional even in the event of a disaster. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you create a DR plan for your application:

1. Identify the critical components: The first step in creating a DR plan is to identify the critical components of your application. This includes your EKS cluster, AWS Aurora Postgres, Instaclustr Cassandra, and AWS Elasticache Redis.

2. Define Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Determine how much data loss and downtime your application can tolerate by defining RPO and RTO respectively. RPO refers to the maximum acceptable amount of data loss, while RTO is the maximum acceptable time to recover the application.

3. Define the recovery process: Define a recovery process for each component, including how you will restore data and how you will bring the component back online.

4. Test the DR plan: Once you have defined the recovery process for each component, test the DR plan to ensure that it works as expected. Perform regular tests to ensure that the DR plan is up-to-date and functional.

5. Document the DR plan: Document the DR plan, including step-by-step instructions on how to recover each component, RPO, and RTO for each component, and any other relevant information.

6. Train the team: Train your team on the DR plan, so they are aware of their roles and responsibilities in the event of a disaster.

7. Review and update the DR plan: Review and update the DR plan regularly to ensure that it remains up-to-date and relevant.

Now, coming to simulating an AWS AZ down for all the tech stacks mentioned:

1. EKS Cluster: To simulate an AWS AZ down for your EKS cluster, you can use the EKS managed node group feature to spread your worker nodes across multiple AZs. This ensures that if one AZ goes down, your application can still continue to run on nodes in the other AZs.

2. AWS Aurora Postgres: To simulate an AWS AZ down for your Aurora Postgres database, you can use the multi-AZ feature. With this feature, AWS automatically replicates your database across multiple AZs, ensuring that if one AZ goes down, your application can still read and write to the database from the other AZs.

3. Instaclustr Cassandra: To simulate an AWS AZ down for your Instaclustr Cassandra database, you can use the Instaclustr multi-region feature. With this feature, Instaclustr replicates your database across multiple regions, ensuring that if one region goes down, your application can still read and write to the database from the other regions.

4. AWS Elasticache Redis: To simulate an AWS AZ down for your Elasticache Redis cluster, you can use the Elasticache multi-AZ feature. With this feature, AWS automatically replicates your Redis cluster across multiple AZs, ensuring that if one AZ goes down, your application can still read and write to the cluster from the other AZs.

Overall, ensure that the DR plan covers all the critical components of your application, including any external dependencies, and that it is tested and updated regularly.
