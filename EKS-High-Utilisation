Dear [Management Team],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about a critical incident that occurred in our PROD environment after the recent release. Our PROD environment experienced a severe memory crunch, which posed a significant risk of service outage. I want to provide an update on the incident and the immediate actions we have taken to mitigate the situation.

Incident Details:
Shortly after the recent release, our PROD environment faced an unexpected surge in memory consumption, resulting in a memory crunch. This had the potential to cause system instability, performance degradation, and ultimately, an outage impacting our end-users and customers.

Immediate Actions Taken:
In response to the alarming situation, our team promptly initiated a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the memory crunch. The investigation revealed that the recent release inadvertently introduced a memory leak in one of the critical components.

Upon identifying the root cause, we immediately implemented a short-term fix to release occupied memory and stabilize the PROD environment. This action allowed us to temporarily free up memory and ensure the continued availability of our services.

Next Steps:
While we have successfully stabilized the PROD environment for the time being, our top priority is to perform a comprehensive rollback of the recent release. This rollback will not only address the memory leak issue but also revert to the previously stable version of the system.

Our team is already in the process of planning and executing the rollback. We anticipate completing the rollback within the next [estimated time] while maintaining continuous monitoring to ensure the stability of our services.

Preventing Future Occurrences:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will conduct a thorough post-incident analysis. This analysis will involve a detailed review of the release process, including testing procedures, to identify any potential vulnerabilities and improve our quality control measures.

We will also reinforce our monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect any memory-related anomalies or performance degradation. This will enable us to take corrective actions before they escalate into critical issues.

Communication Plan:
During this incident, our communication strategy was activated, and our internal team members were kept informed about the ongoing situation. Going forward, we will continue to maintain transparent communication with all stakeholders, ensuring everyone is updated in real-time about any significant developments.

In conclusion, I want to assure you that the situation is under control, and we are taking all necessary measures to restore stability to our PROD environment. Our team is fully committed to resolving this incident as quickly as possible and, more importantly, ensuring that we learn from this experience to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

If you have any questions or require further information, please don't hesitate to reach out. We will keep you updated on the progress of the rollback and any additional actions being taken.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this critical time.

Best regards,
