I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to address the timeout issue you have been experiencing when consuming our services hosted on Kubernetes (K8s) through our owned ingress controller.

We have thoroughly investigated the issue from our end and have analyzed the logs at the ingress controller level. In order to further diagnose and resolve the problem, we kindly request your assistance in providing us with some additional information. Specifically, we need detailed error logs from your client-side environment.

To effectively troubleshoot the issue, we kindly ask you to share any relevant logs or error messages that you have encountered during the connection close error. These logs will provide valuable insights into the behavior of the connection from your perspective and help us identify any potential issues on the client side.

Additionally, it would be helpful if you could provide any relevant details about your environment setup, such as the version of the client application, any network configurations, and any other pertinent information that might assist us in understanding the context of the issue.

Rest assured that we are committed to resolving this problem as quickly as possible. By analyzing the detailed error logs from your client side, our technical team will be able to gain a deeper understanding of the issue and work towards an effective resolution.
